## Project Spotlight: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery with K-Means Clustering

### Problem: Delivery scaling past fleet capacity elevated costs tremendously

In a recent project that won first place in the Supply Chain and Logistics MBA at Fundação Dom Cabral, I used K-means clustering to enhance last-mile delivery logistics. The project identifies high-density customer areas to strategically place advanced inventory locations, reducing delivery time and transportation costs.

The approach involves iterating through the K-means n_clusters hyperparameter to find the optimal number of clusters. As clusters subdivide, they eventually lose the necessary customer density. The selection criteria for the best cluster configuration focus on maximizing customer density and retaining only clusters that meet a specified minimum number of points within a defined radius. Once these optimized clusters are established, large trucks deliver to a central drop-off point, where crowdshipping takes over for final delivery.

This strategic model significantly improves delivery efficiency by reducing stops and placing inventory closer to high-demand areas, enhancing both speed and scalability for modern logistics.
